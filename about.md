# About

I'm Matt Booth — a software developer by day, amateur astrophotographer by night (literally).

This site is where I share what I'm learning about deep-sky imaging: the gear, the processing, the mistakes, and the occasional frame worth keeping. I'm based in the UK, which means I spend a lot of time waiting for clear skies and not nearly enough time actually imaging.

If you have questions or want to chat about anything here, leave a comment on any post — they're powered by GitHub Issues, so you just need a GitHub account.

Clear skies.
