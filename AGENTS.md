## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This repository ("matt-booth") is Matt's personal website. As of initial setup, the repo contains only a `README.md` — no application code, no dependencies, no build system, and no tests.

### Environment

- Node.js v22 and Python 3.12 are available in the VM.
- No package manager lockfile or dependency manifest exists yet.

### Development

Once application code is added, update this section with:
- How to install dependencies
- How to run the dev server
- How to lint and test
- Any non-obvious caveats discovered during setup
